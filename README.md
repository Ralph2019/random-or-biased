# Numbers: random or biased?

Building AI course project

## Summary

The goal of this project is to apply AI algorithms to provide estimates if number sequences are random or biased (by humans).


## Background

Humans have conceptions about randomness:
* in lottery, when choosing 6 numbers out of 49 numbers presented in a 7 x 7 field, humans tend to choose from the numbers located towards the center of the 7 x 7 field, avoiding numbers close to the edges.
* when an array of numbers like (example) 7, 8, 8, 8, 3, 7, 6, 6 is presented, the human concept of randomness is biased towards replacing even numbers with odd numbers, adding more variety, and avoiding short sequences of identical numbers. The human concept of randomness might change the array above towards something like 7, 8, 1, 8, 3, 7, 2, 6 or similar.

Applying tools/methods of AI, the project goal is to detect if arrays of numbers were subject to human interference.

## How is it used?

If a solution can be found, it might be useful to
* help compensate human biases for lotteries
* help detect fraud in manipulated data (science, economy, etc.)

## Data sources and AI methods

For a start, random data are software generated, manipulated manually (with human biases in mind), and subjected to AI-methods to detect the manipulations.
The project is in early phase, further procedure t.b.d.

## Challenges

Main challenge for the start is recherche: to find out what methods and tools are already developed out there in AI developer space, which would be helpful reaching the goal. Another challenge is to find a proper metric that determines the probability of human interference, once a deviation to the randomness of number sequences was detected.

## What next?

Next is recherche if:
* the problem was solved already
* if not already solved yet, what AI algorithms and neural networks are available which could do the job
